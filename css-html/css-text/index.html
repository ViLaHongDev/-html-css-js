        Css provides numerous properties for styling manipulating text within
        web documents. These properties allow control over various aspects of
        text appearance and layout. This text is styled with some of the text
        formatting properties. The heading uses the text-align, text-transform,
        and color properties. The paragraph is indented, aligned, and the space
        between characters is specified. The underline is removed from this
        colored "Try it Yourself" link.
